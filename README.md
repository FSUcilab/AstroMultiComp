# AstroMultiComp

A framework for the simulation of spatially extended non-neuronal cells in the brain (astrocytes).

AstroMultiComp is a simulator for spatially extended astrocytes. It is written in the Python programming 
language. This framework allows experimentalists to simulate and predict signals in simple structures and combinations of 
subcellular compartments of astrocytes.
